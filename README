Part of Netsukuku.

This package hides the complexity of Remote Procedure Call from the business
logic of Netsukuku modules.
Both identity-agnostic and identity-aware modules can communicate with their
peer modules in the neighborhood simply calling and implementing methods on
standard objects.
The ''ntkd'' daemon depends on it.
